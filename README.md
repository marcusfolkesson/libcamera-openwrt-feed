# libcamera OpenWRT feed

## Description

libcamera is an open source camera stack for many platforms with a core userspace library, and support from the Linux kernel APIs and drivers already in place.
It aims to control the complexity of embedded camera hardware by providing an intuitive API and method of separating untrusted vendor code from the open source core.

libcamera aims to encourage the development of new embedded camera applications by limiting the complexity that developers have to deal with.
The interface is designed around the way that modern embedded camera hardware works.
